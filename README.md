# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This site was created to showcase some of the entry level skills I have learned. It also doubles as a resource hub for the notes I have taken along the way. Creating this site gave me hands on learning and it will hold valuable information for me on my continued learning path. (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, ect.)

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is a collection of notes that I have assembled throughout the process of building this site. There are notes on a few topics including, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. These note can be of use to anyone looking to learn how to code. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
